Directed Study: Seminar in Technical Writing for Computer Science
4 credits, Fall 2018, Professor Wand
limited to 10 students.

The goal of this seminar is to help advanced PhD students with writing
and editing technical documents, such as papers and dissertations.  We
will cover basics of good English composition, organization of
sentences, paragraphs, and sections, and other topics.  Our initial
plan is to follow Norman Ramsey's course on Technical Writing Using
the Engineering Method, but the exact topics and emphases will depend
on the students' needs.

We will have a group meeting approximately weekly, and students will
have 1-on-1 sessions with the instructor as appropriate.

Students should be working on papers or dissertations that we can
discuss and analyze.
