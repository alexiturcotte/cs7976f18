<h1>CS 7976: Assignment 2: Editing a Paragraph</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Out:</strong> Wednesday, October 3, 2018
      <br />
      <strong>Due:</strong> Monday, October 8, 2018
    </p>

<hr>

<p>In today's class, we looked at the passages you marked in the
"difficult papers" you brought to the first class.</p>

<p>For next week, I'd like you to rewrite the marked passages in the
two papers you analyzed.</p>

<p>For each paper, extract the marked passage as text, using whatever
tools you like, and turn in a .txt file consisting of the original
text and your edit.  Give the file a name that includes your name and
a couple of words from the title of the paper, so it will be easy for
me to find them.</p>

<p>Then next week, we'll discuss your edits, much as we did today.</p>

<p>I've saved the marked pdfs in Assignments/Papers for Assignment 2.
If we marked more than one passage, you may do either one.  Also, feel
free to rewrite a surrounding paragraph or two, or suggest where the
paragraph in question should be relocated.</p>

<p>Also, if you critiqued a paper that we didn't cover in class, so there is
no marked copy in the repo, then send me a pull request.</p>

<p>For now, let's plan on you turning in this assignment by emailing
me the two text files.   But I may think of something better between
now and Monday.</p>
