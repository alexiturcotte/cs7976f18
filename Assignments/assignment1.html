<h1>CS 7976: Assignment 1: Critiquing a Published Paper</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Out:</strong> Wednesday, September 5, 2018
      <br />
      <strong>Due:</strong> Monday, October 1, 2018

<p>
In my welcome email, I had said: In preparation for our initial meeting, I would like you to
choose a paper in your field that you found particularly confusing or
poorly-written, and bring two copies with you to class on September 5.
</p>

<h3>In-Class Preparation</h3>

<p>Take that paper, and mark one passage (preferably a
paragraph or a few paragraphs) that you found especially confusing,
distracting, or otherwise annoying.
</p>

<p>When you are done, mark that passage in both copies of the paper,
and hand the second copy to the person on your left.  </p>

<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>
For our next class, I want you to critique both papers.  For each paper:
</p>

<ol>

  <li>Start with the passage that's marked.  Identify places
  where the passage violates Ramsey's editing principles,
  Peyton-Jones's advice, or the things we discussed in class?
  </li>

  
  <li>Then zoom out to the paper as a whole.  You may not be familiar
enough with the topic to understand it in detail, but that's OK.
Pretend you've wandered into the wrong conference session :).  To what
extent does the paper violate Peyton-Jones's advice, or any of the
other recommendations we've made?  </li>


</ol>

<p>This assignment is due on MONDAY, October 1.  Please send me both
papers as pdfs and your critique, as a text file.
</p>

<p>On Wednesday, October 3, I plan to show some of the passages you
highlighted, and let the rest of the class critique them.
